# Inter-process Communication (IPC)

Inter-process Communication (IPC) is a technique that allows different processes (usually different applications or programs) to exchange data or messages. In an operating system, a process is a running program, and communication between different processes is essential for multitasking, distributed applications, and other scenarios.

## What is a Process?
In an operating system, a **process** refers to a program that is currently executing. When a program is launched, the operating system assigns a process ID (PID) and loads the program into memory to run.

## Inter-process Communication (IPC)
Inter-process Communication (IPC) refers to how different processes communicate and exchange data or messages. Since operating systems isolate programs from one another, they cannot directly access each other's memory, which is why IPC provides a way for processes to communicate effectively.

### Common IPC Methods:
1. **Pipes**: One process writes data to a pipe, and another process reads from it. Pipes are commonly used for communication between processes on the same machine.
2. **Message Queues**: Processes communicate by sending messages, allowing for asynchronous data transfer.
3. **Shared Memory**: Multiple processes share a block of memory, enabling them to exchange data efficiently.
4. **Semaphores**: Used for synchronization and controlling access to shared resources, preventing data races.
5. **Sockets**: Enable communication between processes on different machines, commonly used for network communication.
6. **Signals**: Processes send signals to notify or control other processes.
7. **Memory-Mapped Files**: Processes can map files into memory and share the data in those files.

## Why is IPC Important?
IPC is crucial for the following:

- **Multitasking**: Running multiple programs simultaneously. For instance, process A might need to send data to process B, which requires IPC.
- **Distributed Applications**: When multiple programs or services are distributed across different computers and work together. IPC helps facilitate communication and data sharing between processes in distributed systems.

## Summary
Inter-process Communication (IPC) is a technique that enables different processes to exchange data and messages. Common IPC methods include pipes, message queues, shared memory, semaphores, and sockets. IPC plays a critical role in multitasking and distributed applications, promoting collaboration and data sharing between processes.
