# Fuzzing Techniques: In-process vs Out-of-process

This document explains two common fuzzing techniques: **In-process Fuzzing** and **Out-of-process Fuzzing**. Both methods are used to find vulnerabilities in software by automatically inputting random, unexpected, or malformed data into the target program, but they differ in how the fuzzing engine interacts with the target application.

## 1. In-process Fuzzing

In Google Security Blog post on [Guided in-process fuzzing of Chrome components](https://security.googleblog.com/2016/08/guided-in-process-fuzzing-of-chrome.html), 

> By in-process, we mean that we donâ€™t launch a new process for every test case, and that we mutate inputs directly in memory.

So  **In-process Fuzzing**, the fuzzer runs within the same process as the target application. The fuzzer directly interacts with the target application's internal state, memory, and variables while executing the program. This approach is commonly used for testing applications that have an embedded API or are designed to work in the same process space.

### Pros
- **Efficiency**: Since both the fuzzer and the target are within the same process, there is minimal overhead from inter-process communication (IPC).
- **Fine-grained Control**: The fuzzer can easily access and manipulate the internal state of the target application, allowing for more precise testing.

### Cons
- **Risk of Impact**: If the target application crashes or encounters a bug, the fuzzer's process might also be affected, potentially halting the entire fuzzing session.
- **Error Handling**: More sophisticated error handling and protections are needed within the target application to ensure the fuzzer can continue running even if the target application fails.

### Use Cases
- Testing embedded software or libraries that require direct interaction with memory or internal states.
- Situations where performance is critical, and minimal overhead is desired.

## 2. Out-of-process Fuzzing

### Overview
In **Out-of-process Fuzzing**, the fuzzer runs as a separate process from the target application. The fuzzer generates input and sends it to the target application via inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms, such as sockets, pipes, or files. The target application runs in its own process, and the fuzzer monitors the behavior of the target.

### Pros
- **Isolation**: The fuzzer and the target application are isolated in separate processes, so if the target crashes, the fuzzer remains unaffected and can continue running.
- **Stability**: Because of the isolation, there is less chance that the fuzzer's environment will be disrupted by crashes or bugs in the target application.
  
### Cons
- **Performance Overhead**: The need for IPC introduces some performance overhead, as communication between separate processes is generally slower than interacting within the same process.
- **Configuration Complexity**: Setting up and managing inter-process communication can add complexity to the fuzzing setup.

### Use Cases
- Testing systems where stability and isolation are important, such as large-scale production applications or multi-component systems.
- When fuzzing networked applications or systems that require separate process environments for safety.

## Comparison: In-process vs Out-of-process Fuzzing

| Feature                  | In-process Fuzzing                   | Out-of-process Fuzzing               |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Performance**           | High, minimal communication overhead | Slower, due to IPC overhead          |
| **Isolation**             | Low, fuzzing shares the same process | High, fuzzing runs in a separate process |
| **Risk of Interruption**  | High, target app crashes affect fuzzer | Low, target app crashes don't affect fuzzer |
| **Setup Complexity**      | Low, direct interaction with the app | Higher, requires IPC setup and management |
| **Use Case**              | Fine-grained testing in low-overhead environments | Stable testing in isolated environments |

## Conclusion

Both **In-process Fuzzing** and **Out-of-process Fuzzing** have their strengths and weaknesses. The choice between them depends on the specific needs of the application being tested, the level of isolation required, and the performance constraints of the fuzzing process.

- **In-process fuzzing** is ideal for applications where speed and direct memory access are important.
- **Out-of-process fuzzing** is better for applications where stability, isolation, and fault tolerance are priorities.

By understanding these techniques, you can select the most appropriate method for fuzz testing your software and uncover potential vulnerabilities effectively.
